      <p>Hi, my name is Shivansh Singh, and I am a student at LUT University in Finland, where I'm doing a BS in Electrical Engineering with a GPA of 4.57. I am a highly motivated and skilled individual with a passion for technology and innovation.

      My experience includes designing camera software for quadcopter drones, developing personal AI systems, creating show recommender systems for Netflix users, and implementing software that accurately predicts student exam marks. I am proficient in several programming languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Matlab. I also have experience with a range of tools and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Microsoft Office Suite, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, MySQL, React, node.js, Arduino, and RaspberryPi.

      In addition to my technical skills, I am a collaborative team player with strong communication and problem-solving skills. I have participated in hackathons, such as Junction, where I collaborated with other developers to design and implement innovative solutions that exceeded the expectations of judges and attendees.

      If you're looking for a skilled and dedicated team player who can deliver innovative solutions to complex problems, please don't hesitate to contact me. You can find my contact information and LinkedIn profile in the resume above. Thank you for your consideration.</p>

       <p>In addition to my educational background and project experience, I possess a wide range of technical skills that enable me to excel in a variety of settings.

       Outside of my work and studies, I also enjoy collecting Pokemon cards as a hobby. I find the colorful designs and playful characters to be a fun and engaging way to unwind and take a break from more technical pursuits. Additionally, I enjoy sketching and playing guitar in my free time, which allows me to express my creativity and explore different forms of self-expression. Overall, I believe that having diverse interests and hobbies helps to keep me well-rounded and engaged in the world around me.</p>
